# [SDF08] Build Your Portfolio MVP

This project involved recreating a portfolio MVP by following a Scrimba video tutorial. With the tutorial as guidance, the task was relatively straightforward. However, some challenges were encountered along the way.

## Please note

For this challenge, I did not replace any images that came with the Scrimba lesson. I did replace all instances of "Jane Smith", excluding alt texts.

## Challenges

Understanding the class names utilized in the Scrimba lesson proved to be a hurdle initially. Additionally, fine-tuning the layout of the page and comprehending certain JavaScript functionalities presented another challenge.

## What I Learned

Completing the project provided valuable learning experiences in web development. The process enhanced understanding of frontend development techniques, including layout design and JavaScript functionality implementation. Moreover, it underscored the importance of attention to detail and problem-solving skills in coding endeavors. Overall, this project served as a foundational step towards honing skills in web development and creating effective project portfolios.

Thank you for reviewing!
